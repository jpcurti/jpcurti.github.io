  paper:
    summary: An assembly comprises several components that can heat up during operation so that they have to be cooled. The assembly can in particular include electrical components, the degree of heating of the individual components being dependent on an operating state of the assembly. A component can be provided with a heat sink, which can be forcibly ventilated with a fan, for example. Depending on the heating of the component, the fan can be activated to provide volume flows of different sizes on the heat sink.

  paper:
    summary: A security device for the detection of manipulations on a bus system of a vehicle as well as an associated vehicle and an associated method are disclosed. A safety device comprises a receiving unit for connection to the bus system of the vehicle and for receiving a signal from the bus system. Furthermore, the device comprises an analysis unit for analyzing a transition between signal states of the signal and an evaluation unit for evaluating the signal as a manipulated signal or non-manipulated signal based on the analysis of the analysis unit.
